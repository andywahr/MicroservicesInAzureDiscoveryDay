Prior to delivering this session, it's extremely important to do the *Emcee or Proctor Pre-setup* section of the [Proctor's Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/blob/master/009-MicroservicesInAzure/Host/Guides/MicroservicesOnAzure-ProctorGuide.docx?raw=true)
 of the Hack.

### Suggested Schedule
The idea is to go over theory and concept in the morning and get to the Hack as soon as possible.  Lunch is recommended to go an hour but doesn't mean the Proctor couldn't be going over some of the content during the second half of Lunch.
